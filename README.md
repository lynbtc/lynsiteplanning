## Code Principles

Every line does work. If you add code, delete something else.

- Single file, no dependencies
- No build step
- Names say what things are
- Comments explain why, not what
- Configuration at the top

## Deploy

Static HTML. Fork, connect to Netlify, deploy.

Forms submit to Netlify Forms by default. To use a custom endpoint, edit `CONFIG.formEndpoint` in `index.html`.
